# Retro Legends Transient OMP Theme

This is my Oh My Posh theme inspired by classic computing history. I wanted to create something that brings back the feel of those amazing vintage terminals while keeping all the modern features I use daily.

## About the Theme

I built this theme around colors that remind me of classic machines - the greens from VT100 phosphor displays, blues from the IBM 3278, and that perfect amber warning color from the Wyse 60. I really love how these old terminals looked, and I wanted to bring some of that feeling to my daily development setup.

If you're into the color scheme, I also made a matching terminal theme you might like: [RetroLegends Terminal Theme](https://github.com/veteranbv/RetroLegends)

## Why I Made This

I've always been fascinated by classic computers and terminals, and I spend a lot of time in my terminal. This theme is my way of bringing together that vintage computing aesthetic I love with all the modern features I need for development. The transient prompt keeps things clean, but you still get all the info you need when you need it.
